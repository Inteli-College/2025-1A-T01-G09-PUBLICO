## Motivation and Justification

By 2025, Artificial Intelligence (AI) will consolidate itself as one of the central drivers of the global economy, driving innovation, efficiency and new competitive dynamics. However, the infrastructure that supports this revolution - cloud processing, data storage and model training capacity - remains largely owned by a select group of corporations and developed countries. Tech giants such as Microsoft, Google and Amazon hold approximately 70% of the global cloud services market, establishing an infrastructure monopoly that defines who can access and use AI competitively.

In emerging markets, this concentration poses some challenges. Companies and governments in these regions depend on foreign infrastructure to host sensitive data, analyze strategic information and develop AI models, which can result in a loss of digital sovereignty and geopolitical vulnerability. The recent suspension of AWS services for Russian companies following the invasion of Ukraine (2022) and the US assessments against China's access to next-generation semiconductors (2023) demonstrate how AI infrastructure has become a tool of economic and geopolitical power. Countries that do not control their digital infrastructure can become hostages to decisions made by a few corporations and foreign governments.

The research aims to investigate how the centralization of AI infrastructure affects the economic sovereignty and competitiveness of emerging markets and which decentralized strategies can mitigate this new form of digital dependence.

## Research Problem

How can the decentralization of AI infrastructure reduce the economic and geopolitical dependence of emerging markets, promoting digital sovereignty and the equitable redistribution of economic value generated by AI?

## Objectives

### General Objectives

To investigate how the concentration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) infrastructure in the hands of large corporations impacts the economic sovereignty, business competitiveness, and macroeconomic stability of Brazil and other emerging markets. In addition, to assess the potential of computational decentralization as a strategy to mitigate geopolitical risks, reduce economic vulnerabilities, and strengthen control over strategic data.

### Specific Objectives

- Map the impacts of AI centralization on the Brazilian and global economy.
- Assess macroeconomic and geopolitical risks of digital dependence.
- Investigate the potential of decentralization to strengthen digital sovereignty.

## Scope

This study will analyze the impact of technological dependence on emerging economies, exploring how the concentration of computational infrastructure affects economic growth, national security, and digital sovereignty. The research will provide a theoretical framework to support public policies and economic strategies aimed at technological autonomy, contributing to debates on innovation, digital governance and development.

The study will seek to identify structural dependencies, regulatory challenges and opportunities for the development of autonomous digital infrastructure. In addition to economic and political changes, the research will consider the impacts on digital security and industrial competitiveness. The project will follow a structured plan, with clear metrics to assess its academic rigor and relevance for policymakers and private sector agents.

### Module 2 - Qualitative Research

The advanced qualitative research of this project aims to provide a detailed and methodologically rigorous analysis of technological concentration and its impacts on emerging economies. The study will be structured with a well-defined research plan, ensuring that the methods adopted – such as interviews with company experts, analysis of public policies or case studies – are appropriate to answer the proposed questions. Hypotheses related to technological dependence, barriers to entry and implications for economic and digital security will be identified and validated. Data collection and analysis will follow recognized techniques, such as content and discourse analysis, allowing a critical evaluation of current policies and strategies.

### Module 3 - Scientific Article Writing and Publication

The writing and publication of the scientific article will follow a process to ensure its academic relevance and impact on the debate on technology and economic development in emerging nations. The first step will be to define a submission plan, establishing quality metrics and acceptance criteria based on academic guidelines. The structure of the article will follow recognized standards, as discussed with the supervisor and in academic meetings. After the previous artifacts, a critical review of the material will be conducted, accompanied by the preparation of figures, tables and graphs that facilitate the interpretation of the results. The manuscript will be written and submitted to prestigious scientific journals in the area of ​​economics and technology, with revisions carried out according to the feedback from the evaluators. In addition, a strategic plan will be developed for disseminating the findings at conferences, symposia and academic events, ensuring that the research contributes to the advancement of discussions on innovation and public policies in emerging contexts.

### Module 4 - Application for Graduate Programs

The artifact aims to structure a detailed and strategic plan for applying to graduate programs, covering all stages of the application process. It includes the careful selection of programs based on academic and professional compatibility, the development of a submission schedule with the definition of KPIs, and preparation for standardized exams through structured study and practice with previous exams. In addition, it addresses strategies for optimizing performance on the day of the exam, analysis of university cultures for better adaptation, financial planning to make the application viable, and writing essays aligned with academic and professional goals. The artifact also guides the formulation of documents for letters of recommendation and the construction of a career plan that integrates the master's degree with long-term professional goals. In this way, the aim is to maximize the chances of acceptance and ensure that the academic trajectory contributes to the professional and intellectual development of the candidate.
