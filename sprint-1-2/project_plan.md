## Motivation and Justification

In 2025, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become one of the main drivers of the global economy, fueling innovation, efficiency, and new competitive dynamics. However, the infrastructure that supports this revolution — cloud processing, data storage, and the capacity to train models — remains largely controlled by a small group of corporations and developed countries. Tech giants like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon dominate around 70% of the global cloud services market, establishing an infrastructure monopoly that determines who can access and utilize AI competitively.

In emerging markets, this centralization presents significant challenges. Companies and governments in these regions rely on foreign infrastructure to store sensitive data, process strategic information, and develop AI models, which can lead to the loss of digital sovereignty and increase geopolitical vulnerability. The recent suspension of AWS services for Russian companies after the invasion of Ukraine (2022) and US sanctions on China's access to advanced semiconductors (2023) demonstrate how AI infrastructure has become a tool of economic and geopolitical power. Countries that do not control their digital infrastructure risk becoming hostages to decisions made by a small number of foreign corporations and governments, directly impacting their autonomy in developing innovations and protecting strategic data.

Furthermore, the centralization of AI exacerbates inequalities between developed nations and emerging markets, where the lack of access to advanced technologies may hinder competitiveness in key sectors like healthcare, finance, and education. Dependence on foreign platforms can also make these markets vulnerable to unfair business practices, such as data manipulation and information monopolization, undermining transparency and fairness.

The research aims to investigate how the centralization of AI infrastructure and models by large corporations reconfigures global power dynamics, affecting the economic and technological sovereignty of emerging markets. Additionally, it seeks to explore what decentralized strategies could mitigate this new form of digital dependency. This includes studying alternatives such as the creation of local cloud computing infrastructures, the development of open-source AI solutions, strengthening international collaboration among developing countries

## Research Problem

How does the centralization of infrastructure and AI models by large corporations reconfigure global power dynamics, impacting the economic and technological sovereignty of emerging markets?

## Objectives

### General Objectives

To investigate how the concentration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) infrastructure in the hands of large corporations impacts the economic sovereignty, business competitiveness, and macroeconomic stability of Brazil and other emerging markets. In addition, to assess the potential of computational decentralization as a strategy to mitigate geopolitical risks, reduce economic vulnerabilities, and strengthen control over strategic data.

### Specific Objectives

- Understand how dependence on centralized infrastructures (AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure) affects the autonomy of local businesses.
- Look for cases of companies that lost competitiveness due to relying on global platforms for data storage and processing.
- Map the impacts of AI centralization on the Brazilian and global economy.
- Assess the macroeconomic and geopolitical risks of digital dependence.
- Investigate the potential of decentralization to strengthen digital sovereignty (edge computing, federated learning).
- Understand if global algorithms trained with data from developed countries fail to understand emerging markets.
- Explore the relationship with open-source initiatives and distributed data by digital cooperatives.
- Understand if the centralization of digital infrastructure by large corporations limits innovation and increases costs for companies (including emerging startups).
- Investigate if decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) can challenge traditional corporate models.
- Explore cases of companies and communities using blockchain to decentralize governance and access to capital.

## Scope

This study will investigate the impact of the centralization of artificial intelligence infrastructure in emerging markets, focusing on technological dependence, its effects on digital sovereignty, economic competitiveness, and geopolitical risks. The research will also explore decentralized alternatives, such as edge computing and federated learning, to mitigate these vulnerabilities and promote greater technological autonomy. By addressing a critical gap in the literature on the digital economy, the study aims to provide a theoretical framework for public policies that promote digital sovereignty and help emerging markets avoid "digital colonization", strengthening their technological and competitive capabilities in the global landscape.
