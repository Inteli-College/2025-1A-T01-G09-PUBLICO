Research Journey – Module 3

The third stage of the project marked a decisive moment in the research process, characterized by the completion of the qualitative data collection, the finalization of the coding and analytical framework, and the consolidation of the theoretical foundation. This module represents the transition from data gathering to structured interpretation, establishing the empirical and conceptual basis for the article’s final discussion.

## Completion of Qualitative Interviews

During this stage, all planned semi-structured interviews with technology leaders were successfully conducted. The participants, occupying strategic positions in highly recognized organizations, provided in-depth insights into the dependence on large technology providers, digital sovereignty, and strategic decision-making in AI infrastructure management.

The interviews revealed recurrent patterns across different institutional contexts, such as concerns about vendor lock-in, financial and operational asymmetries, and the impact of infrastructure centralization on innovation capacity. Moreover, respondents highlighted pragmatic strategies for mitigating dependency, including the development of internal technical teams, adoption of multi-cloud and decentralized architectures, and initiatives to strengthen data governance and autonomy.

These accounts provided robust empirical material for thematic coding and comparison with existing theoretical perspectives, deepening the understanding of how organizations in the Global South operationalize notions of technological sovereignty in 

## Finalization of the Methodological Framework and Coding Tree

Following the completion of the interviews, I finalized the coding tree that structures the qualitative analysis. The coding process synthesized empirical findings into analytical categories that capture the multidimensional nature of AI infrastructure dependence—technological, economic, political, and institutional.

The resulting framework integrates five main analytical axes:
	1.	Technological Dependence and Vendor Lock-In
	2.	Digital Sovereignty and Autonomy
	3.	Economic and Strategic Costs
	4.	Innovation and Technological Capabilities
	5.	Mitigation and Decentralization Strategies, complemented by
	6.	Geopolitical and Regulatory Dimensions

## Consolidation of the Theoretical Framework

The theoretical section was thoroughly revised and finalized in light of the empirical findings. The literature review now integrates contributions from authors such as Crawford (2021), Ferrari et al. (2023), van der Vlist et al. (2024, 2025), Ahmed et al. (2023), and Salama et al. (2023), establishing a solid conceptual bridge between AI centralization, infrastructure geopolitics, and digital sovereignty.

This consolidation reinforced the interpretive alignment between theory and evidence, framing the interviews within broader debates about computational power concentration, data colonialism, and the emerging quest for technological autonomy in the Global South.

The completion of this stage positions the research for the next and final phase—data interpretation and synthesis, where the empirical findings and theoretical insights will converge into a coherent analytical narrative and set of conclusions.
