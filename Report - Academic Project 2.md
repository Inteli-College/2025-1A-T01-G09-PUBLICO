# Research Journey â€“ Module 2

The project evolved with the consolidation of the theoretical framework, the beginning of the qualitative phase, and continuous refinement of the research article. This stage was essential to deepen the conceptual foundation and initiate empirical data collection through interviews with technology leaders from companies.

## Consolidating the Theoretical Framework

With the research question defined, the focus shifted to deepening the conceptual foundations necessary to support the analysis. I explored key authors who investigate the relationship between digital infrastructure, computational power concentration, and technological dependence, such as Kate Crawford (2021), Ferrari et al. (2023), van der Vlist et al. (2024, 2025), and Ahmed et al. (2023).

The theoretical review helped consolidate central concepts for the project, including digital sovereignty, data colonialism, and decentralized alternatives to AI centralization, such as edge computing and federated learning. I also deepened the understanding of AI as strategic infrastructure and a structural factor in contemporary geopolitical inequalities.

## Beginning of Qualitative Interviews

Alongside the theoretical deepening, I structured the semi-structured interview guide for technology executives and leaders from Global South companies. The goal is to understand how these organizations perceive and address their dependence on foreign AI infrastructure, as well as possible pathways to strengthen technological autonomy.

So far, two interviews have been conducted and two more are scheduled. I am constantly seeking contact with professionals from companies such as Mercado Livre, iFood, BTG Pactual, Stone, Nubank, Gerdau, Embraer, and Latam to expand the scope and diversity of the research.

## Ongoing Review of the Article and Concepts

Throughout this module, I maintained a continuous process of reviewing the research article and the theoretical concepts as new readings took place. This iterative approach ensured greater alignment between the theoretical framework, methodology, and empirical data. Ongoing revision also allowed adjustments to the interview guide and research direction, preparing the ground for the data analysis phase.
