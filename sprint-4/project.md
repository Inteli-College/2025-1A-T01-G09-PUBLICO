# Abstract (Scope)

The centralization of artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure presents a strategic challenge for companies in emerging countries, as it compromises their digital sovereignty, economic competitiveness, and geopolitical security. The concentration of data and computational power in a handful of global technology providers limits local innovation, hinders the development of autonomous technological ecosystems, and exposes these countries to dependency on foreign infrastructures. This research aims to understand the implications of such centralization and analyze decentralized alternatives discussed in the literature—such as blockchain, edge computing, and federated learning—that redistribute data processing and may contribute to reducing external dependence while strengthening technological autonomy. The methodology is qualitative, based on semi-structured interviews with experts in the field, seeking to investigate how AI infrastructure centralization affects the technological autonomy of companies in emerging economies and what solutions have been explored to address this dependency. As a practical contribution, this research proposes a theoretical framework to support the formulation of business strategies aimed at building more resilient AI ecosystems, contributing to mitigate the exposure of emerging countries to "digital colonization" and strengthen their position in the global digital economy.

# Introduction (Motivation, Justification, Objectives, Research Question)

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has established itself as one of the primary drivers of the contemporary global economy, fostering innovation, enhancing efficiency, and redefining competitive dynamics across various strategic sectors (Crawford, 2021; van der Vlist et al., 2024). More than an economic vector, AI has begun to restructure power dynamics, consolidating a new informational geopolitics characterized by asymmetries in access to and control over digital infrastructure (Ferrari et al., 2023; Khanal et al., 2024). This infrastructure — comprising data centers, cloud computing platforms, storage systems, and the capacity to train advanced models such as Large Language Models (LLMs) — is highly concentrated in a small number of technology corporations, predominantly headquartered in the United States (Ahmed et al., 2023).

Large global corporations in the technology sector not only provide infrastructure and digital solutions but also exert growing influence over political, economic, and social decisions on a global scale (van der Vlist et al., 2024). This phenomenon, referred to as “Big AI,” reflects a regime of technical interdependence that conceals underlying relations of economic and geopolitical dominance. Countries that lack control over their own digital infrastructure become dependent on decisions made by foreign actors — whether public or private — and face severe constraints on autonomous innovation (Ferrari et al., 2023).

In emerging markets, this asymmetry imposes several challenges: the exclusion of local startups from global innovation ecosystems, dependency on foreign infrastructure for storing and processing strategic data, and the difficulty of adapting algorithmic models to local socio-cultural realities (Luitse & Denkena, 2021). In these contexts, AI centralization not only obstructs development opportunities but also exacerbates historical inequalities, intensifying economic vulnerability and geopolitical exposure (Khanal et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2023).

The increasing politicization of digital infrastructure further complicates this scenario. Public policies adopted by certain governments — particularly in contexts of strategic competition — indicate that private control over data flows, algorithms, and digital platforms can influence electoral processes and political communication practices. By shaping digital environments, large technology corporations influence public discourse, contribute to the establishment of technological standards, and participate in the formulation of guidelines for AI implementation, including within academic and research institutions. This process tends to reinforce a technocratic approach to technological development, often guided by perspectives and interests rooted in the Global North, which may pose challenges to the scientific and cultural autonomy of developing countries (Luchs & Apprich, 2023).

The transformation of AI infrastructure into a strategic asset has revealed systemic risks associated with technological concentration and dependence. Nations lacking control over their digital infrastructure are more susceptible to technological disruptions resulting from political decisions or external economic interests. This vulnerability underscores the importance of digital sovereignty as a critical component of national resilience in an increasingly data-driven global context (Smith et al., 2022).

Moreover, AI centralization amplifies preexisting disparities. Emerging markets face barriers to accessing high-performance infrastructure, undermining their capacity to compete in critical sectors such as healthcare, education, and finance (Crawford, 2021; Luchs & Apprich, 2023). Dependence on foreign platforms also exposes these economies to unfair practices such as data monopolization and algorithmic manipulation, negatively affecting equity, transparency, and informational sovereignty (Luitse & Denkena, 2021).

Given this context, this study aims to answer the following research question: How does the centralization of artificial intelligence infrastructure and models by major technology corporations reshape global power dynamics and impact the economic and technological sovereignty of emerging markets? The analysis considers the technical interdependence between AI and cloud platforms; the role of big techs in shaping national strategies; the macroeconomic and geopolitical risks of digital dependence; and the feasibility of decentralized solutions—such as blockchain, edge computing, and federated learning—in contexts with limited infrastructure (Lim et al., 2022; Salama et al., 2023).

This article seeks to contribute to the debate on digital sovereignty by proposing a new theoretical framework to support the formulation of business strategies and public policies aimed at building AI ecosystems that are more resilient, equitable, and autonomous. The ambition is clear: to mitigate the systemic vulnerabilities that threaten companies in emerging economies (Ferrari et al., 2023; van der Vlist et al., 2025).
