## The Centralization of AI Infrastructure and Its Geopolitical Implications
Contemporary literature converges on the understanding that large-scale AI is not possible without the infrastructure provided by big tech companies. The concept of “Big AI” reveals the structural symbiosis between AI models and cloud platforms operated by Amazon, Microsoft, and Google (van der Vlist et al., 2024). This concentration not only shapes access to computational resources but also redefines the very field of AI research, as exemplified by the controversy surrounding the dismissal of Timnit Gebru from Google (Luitse & Denkena, 2021).

Recent studies also highlight how the re-election of populist and pro-market leaders in the United States — such as Donald Trump — finds support in informal coalitions with key figures in the tech sector, enabled by their control over sensitive data and algorithmic capacity to shape political narratives (Khanal et al., 2024). AI infrastructure thus becomes a vector of biopower, in the Foucauldian sense, constituting what some authors have referred to as the “Big Tech Raj” (Leclercq-Vandelannoitte & Bertin, 2024).

## Decentralized Approaches: Federated Learning and Edge Computing
The rise of Edge AI — artificial intelligence processed at the edge of the network — emerges as a technological counter-narrative to prevailing centralization. Models such as Federated Learning allow devices to collaboratively build algorithms without exposing sensitive data, thereby preserving privacy and improving latency. These models have shown robust applications in contexts such as Industry 4.0 and the Internet of Things (Farahani & Monsefi, 2023; Lim et al., 2022).

Such solutions also prove viable for countries with infrastructure constraints, as demonstrated by the E-Tree model, which enhances training convergence and accuracy in non-homogeneous environments (Yang et al., 2020). Furthermore, the combined use of blockchain and federated learning — known as FLchain — adds layers of transparency, auditability, and decentralized incentives for collaboration among AI agents (Nguyen et al., 2021; Witt et al., 2024).
