# Research Journey – Module 1

The development of a scientific research project is a non-linear process, marked by successive iterations between theoretical review, methodology, and writing. In this project, the initial path was structured in five "sprints" that helped shape the proposal, from the formulation of the research question to the writing of some key sections of the first draft of the paper (introduction, justification, objectives, and methodology).

## Formulating the Research Question

The project idea came from a professional curiosity about how a few tech companies, mostly based in developed countries, are concentrating control over digital infrastructure, computing power, and data. By observing how this affects access to artificial intelligence (AI), especially in emerging countries, a central question emerged: to what extent does this centralization undermine the technological sovereignty of these countries?

This first stage was exploratory. Through initial readings and conversations with professionals in the field, I realized that this is a topic of both scientific and political importance. As a result, I defined the central research question:
How does the centralization of infrastructure and AI models by large tech corporations reshape global power dynamics and impact the economic and technological sovereignty of emerging markets?

## Building Theoretical Foundations

Once the main problem was defined, I began searching for theoretical references to better understand the topic. I read authors like Kate Crawford (2021), E. Ferrari et al. (2023), and F. van der Vlist et al. (2024, 2025), who explain how AI, when based on highly centralized platforms, can increase inequalities between rich and poor countries. I also studied Eisenhardt (1989) and Yin (2015), both key references in qualitative research and case study methodology.

At this stage, I identified the main concepts that structure the analysis, such as digital sovereignty, technological dependence, data colonialism, alternative infrastructures, and technical interdependence. I also explored technologies that may help decentralize AI usage, such as edge computing, blockchain, and federated learning.

## Academic Writing

Next, I focused on understanding how to write a scientific paper. More than just following formatting or citation rules, I learned how each section plays a specific role in guiding the reader and presenting the research effectively.

I analyzed national and international articles, especially in the fields of political science, technology studies, and the digital economy. This helped me observe how authors structure their arguments, connect theory with data, and build clear and well-defined research questions.

I also deepened my knowledge of different types of qualitative research, when to use single or multiple case studies, and what criteria ensure the validity of a study in this approach.

## Structuring the Text

With the theoretical and methodological foundations in place, I moved on to writing two key parts of the paper: the introduction and the methodology.

In the introduction, my goal was to clearly show why the centralization of AI is such a relevant issue today. I presented the main challenges involved, the research objectives, and the guiding research question. I used recent data and key authors to show that this is not only a technical issue, but one that also has political, economic, and social implications — especially for developing countries.

In the methodology section, I chose a qualitative approach, combining Eisenhardt’s strategy of multiple case studies with Yin’s method for analyzing real-world phenomena in context. The research plan includes semi-structured interviews with professionals working in tech and financial companies in Latin America. Participants will be intentionally selected based on their level of digital maturity and experience with decentralized technologies like blockchain and edge computing.

In addition to interviews, secondary sources such as technical reports, academic papers, and public documents will also be used to enrich the analysis. The data will be analyzed using an iterative logic, including careful reading of transcripts, coding of key excerpts, organizing them into categories, and comparing findings with the literature — all to ensure a deep and reliable analysis.

With this, I completed the first written version of the project, bringing together all the elements developed in the previous stages. The text already includes: an executive summary, presenting the research scope, relevance, and objectives; a structured introduction, connecting the problem, justification, and goals; and a detailed methodology, outlining all steps of the research.

With the project at an advanced stage, the next steps will be conducting the interviews, analyzing the data collected, and writing the remaining sections of the paper.
